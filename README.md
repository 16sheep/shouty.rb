# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 500m kan hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/Cucumber course.

## Agenda

### Set up environment

* Install Ruby
* Clone this repo
* Run `gem install bundler`
* Run `bundle`
* Run `bundle exec cucumber`

You should see:

    1 scenario (1 passed)

### Brainstorm capabilities

* Who are the main stakeholders?
* What can people do with the app?
* What are the main differentiators from other apps?

### Pick one capability

* Define rules
* Create high level examples (Friends episodes)

Then do this for each example to discover more examples:

* Can you think of a context where the outcome would be different?
* Are there any other outcomes we haven't thought about?

### Implement one capability. Text UI only.

* Write a Cucumber Scenario for one of the examples
* Make it pass!
